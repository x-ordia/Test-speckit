# Feature Specification: Orchestrator Agent with SQL and Ticket Analysis Tools

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-fastapi`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a FastAPI backend that functions as an intelligent *Orchestrator Agent*. This orchestrator must accept a user prompt via a POST endpoint. It must use Google Gemini's Function Calling feature for intent routing (agent handoff). *The system must support two specialized agents (tools):* 1. *SQL Generator Agent:* Called when the user asks a data query. * *Function:* sql_generator(prompt: str) * *Logic:* Simulates generating SQL using a defined dummy schema (which the orchestrator's system prompt must include).2. *Ticket Analyser Agent:* Called when the user describes a technical issue or ticket. * *Function:* ticket_analyser(ticket_title: str, ticket_description: str) * *Logic:* Simulates searching a dummy database of past tickets for similar issues and returns the stored resolution. The orchestrator must execute the chosen tool and present the result as the final response."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to provide a prompt to an orchestrator agent, so that it can route my request to the appropriate specialized agent (either a SQL Generator or a Ticket Analyser) and return the result.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user submits a natural language query for data, **When** the orchestrator receives the prompt, **Then** it should call the `sql_generator` function and return the simulated SQL query.
2. **Given** the user submits a description of a technical issue, **When** the orchestrator receives the prompt, **Then** it should call the `ticket_analyser` function and return the simulated resolution from a past ticket.
3. **Given** the user submits a prompt that is neither a data query nor a technical issue, **When** the orchestrator receives the prompt, **Then** it should return a message indicating that it could not determine the correct tool to use.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user prompt is empty? The system should return an error message.
- What happens if the `sql_generator` or `ticket_analyser` functions fail? The system should return an error message.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a POST endpoint to accept user prompts.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST use Google Gemini's Function Calling feature for intent routing.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST include a `sql_generator` tool.
- **FR-004**: The `sql_generator` tool MUST accept a `prompt` string as a parameter.
- **FR-005**: The `sql_generator` tool MUST simulate generating a SQL query based on a dummy schema.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST include a `ticket_analyser` tool.
- **FR-007**: The `ticket_analyser` tool MUST accept `ticket_title` and `ticket_description` strings as parameters.
- **FR-008**: The `ticket_analyser` tool MUST simulate searching a dummy database of past tickets and return a stored resolution.
- **FR-009**: The orchestrator MUST execute the chosen tool and return the result as the final response.
- **FR-010**: The orchestrator's system prompt MUST include the dummy schema for the `sql_generator`.
